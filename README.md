## Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling
#### with applications in population dynamics and ecology

I developed these notes and python codes for the course "BIO397 Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling" that I taught at the [University of Zurich](https://www.biologie.uzh.ch/de/Studium/AllgemeineInformationen/OLATFS2016.html). This course was designed for 3rd-year BSc Biology students without a strong background in complex systems modeling and in programming with python.
